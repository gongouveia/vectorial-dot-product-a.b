# vectorial-dot-product-a.b


This repo has a vector dot product in vhdl, testbenched and  synthesized
In this repo there is two implemenattions of the dot product between two vectors.


in the dot_product_sfixed can be found the tested implementation of the dot ptoduct using float operations.
the sfixed format is sfixed(7 down to -8) [Q8.8]

Both examples are tested and quickly adapted to other vector sizes
